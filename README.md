# Guess the Word Game

## Overview
"Guess the Word" is a simple Python game where players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by inputting letters. Players have a limited number of attempts and can request hints to assist them in guessing the word.

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as compiled Python files and virtual environment directories.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
